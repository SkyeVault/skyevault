# Lorelei Noble

Hi, I'm Lorelei Noble, an open-source software enthusiast and web developer.  Projects include Terraform and Proxmox automation, 3D environments using Three.js, decentralized infrastructure, blockchain development, security research, and Rust-based tooling.  I recently moved my netlify astro space to a self-hosted static site.  I love configuring DNS, NGINX, and firewall settings.
